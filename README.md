# Internship-data-analysis-space-physics
This is the code I created for a summer research internship.
The code extracts data such as magnetic field, density and velocity of plasma from satellites in the solar wind and magnetosheath and it is doing data analysis on the time of an interplanetary shock.

The functions.py file contains all the functions that I defined and that I use in the main code to make it a bit cleaner.
Read the doc to get information on how to run code_internship.py.
Get_date_shock_CFA is a code that will get all the FF shocks from the CFA website for a specific year and input the data in a csv file.
